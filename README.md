#### Python OOP
1. Creating and instantiating classes
2. Inheritance
3. Class and instance variables
4. Static methods and class methods

Why to use classes? <br>
They allow us to logically group our data and functions which is highly managable<br>
What are attributes and methods<br>
class = Car<br>
    1 attributes = Make, Model, Year, Trim<br>
    2 methods = StartEngine, Speed, Door Lock<br>
class = Employee<br>
emp_1 = Employee() # object
1. attributes = Name, email, pay <br>
2. methods = Pomote/Demote, PayRaise, add/remove employee
